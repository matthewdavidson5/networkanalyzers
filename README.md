Contains python scripts using Pyshark and various data viz. libraries to emulate 
the analysis functionality of Wireshark in a more comprehensive and graphically appealing way.

Scripts are executed from a shell via "python3 script.py -flags". 
Traditionally, packet capture is performed at runtime but users may optionally supply a 
packet capture file (.pcap) for analysis.
